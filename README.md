# Advent of Code

Here are my solutions to the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles

I started in 2022 at the advice of one of my teachers, and have continued for each year after.

2025 is the first year I finished it, so this repo current only contains my solutions for that year (2025 is also the only year so far with only 12 puzzles instead of 25, but oh well).
